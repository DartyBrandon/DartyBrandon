My name is Brandon.
I'm currently in school for IT Security and taking a Udemy course to learn Python programming.
I work full-time as a senior customer service representative at SD Wheel corp. and am a new father as well
I'm looking to learn as much as I can and to figure out exactly what I would like to do in the IT field
